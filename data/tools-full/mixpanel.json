Leveraging Event Properties allows you to conduct deeper analysis to better understand user behavior for a specific action. For example, a 'Song Added to Playlist' event could have 'Artist' and 'Playlist' as the properties. Properties are sent as key-value pairs where the key is the property name and the value is the property value."
